- Allows batch operations and scripting

### TUI (Terminal User Interface)
- Interactive terminal-based interface for visual dotfile management
- Menu-driven system for common operations
- Real-time status display of managed files
- Visual diff and conflict resolution tools

### Core Engine
- Wraps Chezmoi functionality with enhanced features
- Handles configuration management
- Provides unified interface for both CLI and TUI
- Implements security and validation checks

## Technical Stack
- Language: Go (for performance and compatibility with Chezmoi)
